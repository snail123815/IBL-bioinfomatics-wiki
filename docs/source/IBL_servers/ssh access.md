To use our Linux servers, you'll need access to a <u>c</u>ommand <u>l</u>ine <u>i</u>nterface (CLI). Just to make a connection, you can use both CLI and **g**raphical <u>u</u>ser <u>i</u>nterface (GUI).

This tutorial will provide you detailed guidance in setting up your first SSH connection. Since this tutorial is targeting both Windows/MacOS/Linux operating systems, I will briefly touch upon the topic of differences between Windows and "Unix like" MacOS/Linux systems.

In any case, you need to first:

## Determine your network location

The IBL servers are setup inside Leiden University's [Research Network](./Intro.md#what-is-research-network), which means **intranet**. To protect intranet from **internet**, all connections need to pass through gateway servers hosted by Leiden University. Of course, if you are inside our Leiden University intranet, you can make direct connections to IBL servers.

[Determine your network location](./Intro.md#determine-your-network-location)

If you are working on your own computer, even if it is an university managed laptop, no matter you can connected to the Research Network or not, it is always good to [setup connection using ssh through SSH gateway](#setup-connection-using-ssh-through-ssh-gateway)

Otherwise, from an university managed **desktop**, you can [connect with a direct SSH connection](#make-direct-ssh-connection).

For GUI setup, [follow this tutorial](./ssh%20access%20winscp.md).

## Start a command line interface

<u>C</u>ommand <u>l</u>ine <u>i</u>nterface (CLI) is hosted by a program called **shell**. Here's how to started a shell program on different operating systems:

- For MacOS (Apple operating system) users, open the "Terminal" application by typing "Terminal" in spotlight.
- For Linux users, open the "Terminal" application (sometimes it is directly called "shell").
- For Windows users, there are several options:
  - (Recommended) [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/downloads.php) + [PuTTY](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/putty/XPFNZKSKLBP7RJ). These programs are open source and free for personal use. You can download and run them without installation. It is friendly to university/company computers where you cannot install program by yourself. This solution can setup connection in GUI environment, you can skip the rest of this tutorial and go to [GUI tutorial](ssh%20access%20winscp.md).
  - (Recommended) [Git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org) provide "GitBash" program that comes with a <u>shell</u> environment similar to Linux systems, and the settings will also be the same as Linux. The "GitBash" program can be executed without installation.
  - WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) with the any Linux distribution. You can find more detailed instructions on how to install and start it [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Once you have WSL setup correctly, you will have access to a pure <u>shell</u> environment, simply set the connection up as you are using Linux.
  - **PowerShell** comes by default with Windows. The default version comes with the software called "openSSH", providing command line program `ssh`. However, I recommend you to use the latest version of PowerShell, [install it from "Microsoft Store"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows#installing-from-the-microsoft-store). If that is unsuccessful, check other methods from the link. We do not recommend computer novices to choose this method, as it may cause unforeseen problems and the commands to set up may be slightly different. Prepare to spend a bit more time on it.

```{admonition} Do not copy directly
:class: warning
**DOUBLE CHECK COMMANDS BEFORE EXECUTING THEM**

Please note that in this tutorial, we do not know the IP address you are connecting to, your `USERNAME`, or your `ULCN`. Please carefully check the commands you copy and adjust them accordingly. Becareful about **cases** and **spaces**. Especially, do not miss a **space**! They have special meanings for comands and are very important!

Some commands are quite long, please use the scroll bar underneath the command line to see it complete.

In CLI, you cannnot use your mouse. To edit the command easily, you can use a simple text editor, for example Notepad (windows), Nano (Linux), and TextEdit (MacOS), copy and edit your command there.
```

## Setup connection using ssh through SSH gateway

As explained before, all connections except those made on university desktops need to pass through a gateway server to protect our intranet. We recommend you use [Leiden University general purpose gateway](./Intro.md#leiden-university-general-purpose-gateway). Using ALICE gateway is **not** recommended. If you use, you need to use ALICE gateway URL and your ALICE account for the gateway. !!Use ALICE gateway at your own risk!!

URL of general purpose gateway is `sshgw.leidenuniv.nl`. Once you are able to log in to the gateway following [this tutorial (login needed)](https://helpdesk.universiteitleiden.nl/tas/public/ssp/content/detail/knowledgeitem?unid=4b176453-ad3f-418f-9c15-40a11471de5f), you can proceed with the following setups. It's perfectly safe to access the servers through the gateway, even if you're already within Research Network.

GOAL: Once you've completed this setup, you can access our servers (e.g., BLIS) from your computer with a single command: `ssh blis`, `ssh frodo`, or `ssh bilbo`.

Depends on the operating system you use, you might choose command line interface (CLI, follow the instruction on this page) or [graphical user interface (GUI)](./ssh%20access%20winscp.md#ssh-connection-through-gui).

## SSH connection through CLI

CLI on all system shares the same commands except in PowerShell on Windows systems. The major difference is how to represent a file or directory (folder) path.

```{admonition} Representation of Path
<u>Windows systems</u> uses "`DriveLetter:\path\to\your\file`", for example `"C:\Users\Public\Documents\"`. This is the same for Microsoft programs including CMD and PowerShell. The path starts with a drive letter followed by a colon "`C:`" to indicate which drive it belongs, then uses "**backslash**", "`\`", to separate directory hierarchy.

<u>Linux/MacOS/GitBash</u> however, only uses "**forwardslash**", "`/`", to separate directory hierarchy. The **full path** always starts from the "**root**" directory represented by a single "`/`". For example, the <u>GitBash representation</u> of the above mentioned directory will be "`/c/Users/Public/Documents/`", it is because GitBash convert Windows paths to "linux like". In <u>WSL</u>, Windows file systems will be **mounted** at location "`/mnt/`", thus the above path is then "`/mnt/c/Users/Public/Documents/`".

Note:
1. A standing pipe "`|`" that will fall forward (right side) "`/`" is a "forwardslash"
2. Only Windows system do not care letter cases. Thus, it is good practice to always use correct cases for commands and paths.

**Home directory** is where your user files located. In Linux, it is usually "`/home/[username]`". It can be safely represented by a telda mark "`~`" in Linux. So, in Linux, "`~`" = "`/home/[username]`". In Windows, the home directory is "`C:\Users\[UserName]`", it sometimes can also be replaced by a telda mark in some latest version of PowerShell. However, telda mark "`~`" cannot be reliablly parsed in PowerShell, in most cases, replacing it with a more complex "`$HOME`" or even "`$env:HOME`" is needed.
```

There are four steps:

1. [Creeate ssh key pair](#create-ssh-key-pair)
2. [Let server recognise your key](#let-server-recognise-your-key)
3. [Configure local machine to use a correct key](#configure-local-machine-to-use-a-correct-key)
4. [Connect](#connect)

(create-ssh-key-pair)=
### 1. Create ssh key pair

In your terminal do:

```shell
# Create a directory/folder called ".ssh"
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
# For PowerShell users, you may need to
# replace ~ with $HOME or $env:HOME,
# follow this rule in all following commands. For example
mkdir -p $HOME/.ssh

# Generate a key pair:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "From my PC" -f ~/.ssh/iblservers
```

When you execute this command, you'll be prompted to enter a "passphrase". You can simply press ENTER to proceed. Otherwise this passphrase will be asked every time you use this key, (too) much  safer.

You should see some output looks like this:

```text
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in iblservers
Your public key has been saved in iblservers.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:M2238Cx5UCQgGivrRI5gtay92U3QULSQtTneghU2kO8 From my PC
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|   ..+OB... .    |
|  o .*=.*  o     |
|..ooo..B    .    |
|o+oo  =.o. .     |
|..+. ..+S.= .    |
| o  + oE.+ B .   |
|  .o . .  o =    |
|           o     |
|                 |
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

By running this command, you have actually created a pair of files that we refer to as a "key pair":

```sh
~/.ssh/iblservers
~/.ssh/iblservers.pub
# If you are using PowerShell, remember these are in
C:\Users\[UserName]\.ssh\
```

![ssh key pair illustration](../_static/images/ssh_keygen_drawing.svg)

The file `iblservers` is your private key. Be sure not to share its contents with anyone;
The `iblservers.pub` file is your public key, which you will add to the `authorized_keys` file of all servers using the `ssh-copy-id` command.

You can use the same key pair to access all servers. However, it's safer to create a separate key pair for accessing the gateway. We highly recommend following this practice, and the rest of this tutorial will assume that you have created a separate key pair for accessing the gateway:

```shell
# For PowerShell users, please remember to
# replace ~ with $HOME or $env:HOME, I will not remind you again ;-)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "From my PC" -f ~/.ssh/sshgwLeidenuniv
```

(let-server-recognise-your-key)=
### 2. Let server recognise your key

However, you also need to inform the servers that these keys belong to you and that you should be allowed to use them when logging in. To be sure that is you that is adding these keys, you are going to use your username and password to login. This process is different for PowerShell on Windows compared to MacOS / Linux / GitBash / Cygwin. Please refer to the correct section for your setup.

:::{note}
This process involves entering passwords, so it's important to be extremely careful with the passwords you use.

- For the <u>gateway</u> connection, enter your **ULCN password** when the prompt says 

  ```text
  ULCN@sshgw.leidenuniv.nl's password:
  ```

- For the <u>IBL servers</u> connection, enter the **password you received** via email when the prompt says

  ```text
  USERNAME@999.999.999.999's password:
  ```

  If it is the first time login, you will receive `Password expired. Change your password now.` notification. Enter your given password again, followed by your new password twice. Your old password will be deactivated once succeed.
:::

#### 2.1 On Windows using PowerShell

As the `ssh-copy-id` program is not available in Windows PowerShell, an alternative method is required to configure the server to recognize the generated keys.

Compose the following one line command with your ULCN username:

```PowerShell
# Scroll to the right for full command
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\sshgwLeidenuniv.pub | ssh ULCN@sshgw.leidenuniv.nl "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Type your **ULCN** password to complete the operation. Now you have copied the corresponding public key `sshgwLeidenuniv.pub` to our university Gateway server. **Note** here in PowerShell, `$env:USERPROFILE` is a replacement of `~` for the "HOME" directory.

Now copy the corresponding public key `iblservers.pub` to our IBL servers using the following command. Do change the IP address 999.999.999.999 to the IP of BLIS, you can run the same command multiple times using IP address of other servers:

```PowerShell
# Scroll to the right for full command
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\iblservers.pub | ssh USERNAME@999.999.999.999 "mkdir -p .ssh && cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"
```

#### 2.2 On MacOS, Linux, GitBash, Cygwin

`ssh-copy-id` program exists on these systems. The command to add the `sshgwLeidenuniv` key pair to the Gateway and upload the corresponding public key file is:

```shell
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/sshgwLeidenuniv.pub ULCN@sshgw.leidenuniv.nl
```

Remember to replace `ULCN` with your actual ULCN username in the command. After running the command, you will be prompted to enter your ULCN password. When succeeded, you should see output containing:

```text
...
Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'ULCN@sshgw.leidenuniv.nl'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

Do not try it just yet (or if you tried, remember to `exit` back to your local machine). Now, from your local machine, add `iblservers.pub` key to BLIS. Do change the IP address 999.999.999.999 to the IP of BLIS, you can run the same command multiple times using IP address of other servers:

```shell
ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/iblservers.pub -o ProxyJump=ULCN@sshgw.leidenuniv.nl USERNAME@999.999.999.999
```

Remember to replace `ULCN` with your ULCN username, `USERNAME` with the username provided in the email, and `999.999.999.999` with the actual IP address provided in the email. Pay attention to which password it asks for. After your password is accepted, the command should finish with output containing:

```text
...
Number of key(s) added: 1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh -o 'ProxyJump=ULCN@sshgw.leidenuniv.nl' 'USERNAME@999.999.999.999'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

You can try it by following the instructions, but now you should be able to connect from your local machine using a easier command.

(configure-local-machine-to-use-a-correct-key)=
### 3. Configure local machine to use a correct key

After above steps, you still cannot access the gateway and our servers with the ssh keys, ie, you still need to use your password every time you connect. To make our efforts yield valuable results, ou need to add the correct configuration to your `~/.ssh/config` file on your local machine. This is the configuration file for `ssh` program to know which key to use when connecting to a specific server.

You must have noticed that in previous steps, we have generated two key pairs for "gateway" and "IBL servers" (BLIS, FRODO, BILBO). This is because we have the following infrastructure setup as indicated in the section [Set up connection using ssh through SSH gateway](#setup-connection-using-ssh-through-ssh-gateway).

![IBL server infrastructure](../_static/images/ssh_jump_drawing.svg)

Change and execute the multiple lines command below. 

#### 3.1 On Windows using PowerShell

```{code-block} PowerShell
---
emphasize-lines: 3, 7, 8, 9
caption: Do not forget to change USERNAME and IP address
---
"
Host sshgw.leidenuniv.nl
    User ULCN
    HostName sshgw.leidenuniv.nl
    IdentityFile $HOME/.ssh/sshgwLeidenuniv

Host blis
    User USERNAME
    HostName 999.999.999.999
    # Use BLIS IP address in the above line
    ProxyCommand ssh -A sshgw.leidenuniv.nl -p 22 -q -W %h:%p
    IdentityFile $HOME/.ssh/iblservers
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 10
" | Set-Content -Path $HOME/.ssh/config -Encoding UTF8 -NoNewline
```

If you also want to directly connect to another server, open the `C:\Users\[UserName]\.ssh\config` file in a text editor and add repeated content of the last section (start with the line "Host ...") and change the information of the other server. Make sure after you save the file, it does not have any file extension, `config.txt` will not work. Check Google for how to show all file extensions in Explorer. `.ssh/` directory is sometimes hidden. To find it, configure your file explorer to show hidden files.

#### 3.2 On MacOS, Linux, GitBash, Cygwin

```{code-block} shell
---
emphasize-lines: 3, 7, 8, 9
caption: Do not forget to change USERNAME and IP address
---
echo "
Host sshgw.leidenuniv.nl
    User ULCN

    HostName 999.999.999.999
    # Use BLIS IP address in the above line
    ProxyCommand ssh -A sshgw.leidenuniv.nl -p 22 -q -W %h:%p
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/iblservers
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 10

" >> ~/.ssh/config
```

```{note}
Please note that the command above appends text to the config file. **Do not run it again** if you need to make changes to the configuration. Instead, open the file directly using a text editor to change.
```

If you also want to directly connect to another server, open the `~/.ssh/config` file in a text editor and add repeated content of the last section (start with the line "Host ...") and change the information of the other server. `.ssh/` directory is always hidden. To find it, configure your file explorer to show hidden files.

(connect)=
### 4. Connect

You have successfully generated and stored the keys on your local computer. You have also configured your computer to use these keys when connecting to the gateway and the BLIS server. Now you should be able to login BLIS with one command from your local machine:

```sh
ssh blis
```

This command will use the configuration you added to your `.ssh/config` file for the `Host blis` section to connect to the BLIS server. It will connect with your provided `USERNAME` and to the specific host, which in our case is provided as an IP address.

Once inside BLIS, you can directly connect to another servers using `ssh` command plus lower case server name.

(ALICE uses the same setup, please refer to [How to login to ALICE or SHARK - HPC wiki](https://pubappslu.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HPCWIKI/pages/37748771/How+to+login+to+ALICE+or+SHARK).)

:::{note}
Before you run any programs, you have to understand that we use "environments" to manage softwares on all systems. On BLIS, we use `micromamba`, a `conda` replacement, for environment management, [check it out](../IBL_servers/Execute%20programs.md).
:::

(make-direct-SSH-connection)=
## Make direct SSH connection (University Desktop with PowerShell)

If you have a desktop computer that is connected to a Ethernet socket on the wall, you don't need to jump from the University's SSH-gateway. It is recommanded to setup using the [GUI tutorial](./ssh%20access%20winscp.md#make-direct-ssh-connection-using-winscp-university-desktop-with-powershell). If you insist, please go on reading.

**PowerShell** comes by default with Windows. The default version comes with the software called "openSSH", providing command line program `ssh`. However, I recommend you to use the latest version of PowerShell, [install it from "Microsoft Store"](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows#installing-from-the-microsoft-store). If that is unsuccessful, check other methods from the link. Try the default "Windows PowerShell" directly from your start menu if you cannot get the latest version of PowerShell from Microsoft Store.

We do not recommend computer novices to choose this method, as it may cause unforeseen problems and the commands to set up may be slightly different. Prepare to spend a bit more time on it.

You can omit key generation steps for `sshgwLeidenuniv`. Only create `iblservers`, `iblservers.pub` key pair and copy `iblservers.pub` directly to our server. The `config` file in `C:\Users\[UserName]\.ssh\` directory can also be simplified.

```{code-block} PowerShell
---
emphasize-lines: 7, 8, 9, 19
caption: Do not forget to change USERNAME and IP address
---
# Create ssh key pair
mkdir -p $env:HOME/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "From my PC" -f $env:HOME/.ssh/iblservers

# Confige your local machine to use the keys
"
Host blis
    User USERNAME
    HostName 999.999.999.999
    # Use BLIS IP address in the above line
    ProxyCommand ssh -A sshgw.leidenuniv.nl -p 22 -q -W %h:%p
    IdentityFile $HOME/.ssh/iblservers
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 10
" | Set-Content -Path $HOME/.ssh/config -Encoding UTF8 -NoNewline

# Add keys to the server, scroll to the right for full command
type $env:USERPROFILE\.ssh\iblservers.pub | ssh USERNAME@999.999.999.999 "mkdir -p .ssh && cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

# Connect
ssh blis
```

If you also want to directly connect to another server, open the `C:\Users\[UserName]\.ssh\config` file in a text editor and add repeated content of the last section (start with the line "Host ...") and change the information of the other server. Make sure after you save the file, it does not have any file extension, `config.txt` will not work. Check Google for how to show all file extensions in Explorer. `C:\Users\UserName\.ssh\` directory is sometimes hidden. To find it, configure your file explorer to show hidden files.

## No Guarantee

There is no guarantee that the procedure will be completely the same on your machine, if you find it strange, please read the screen and you should be able to sort out. If not, please make screen shots and create a "New issue" ([@snail123815](https://github.com/snail123815/IBL-bioinformatics-wiki/issues)) (or send me an email (c.du\[at\]biology.leidenuniv.nl) with your screen shots and detailed information).
