## Contribute more

If you think I am too slow on responding your issues, you are more than welcome to contribute by making changes directly. It is a bit more work then you might think, but I am sure you will learn a lot from the process.

Check the [front page ("Code" tab if you in the "Issues" tab)](https://github.com/snail123815/IBL-bioinformatics-wiki) of our GitHub repository. I wrote a brief introduction on how to do this in README file.
